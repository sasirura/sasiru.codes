## Little bit About Myself Now
I have been working with computers and software development for about four years (professionally almost two years ), all of them web-based.
My primary language is PHP, with Symphony framework and Drupal, though I have also used:  
- NodeJS/React/Vue - worked on these frameworks in my previous company
- Python - wrote scripts for calculations and plottings when I was an undergraduate student

## For the Future Me


I always think I'm not just a programmer and I don't want to be. I like to explore new technologies and build tools with them. I procastinate to this exploring in the past but It's time to start this because I start to learn Drupal/PHP starting from this year since it's my company requirement. I didn't know anything about Drupal/PHP 

  
So I'm going to write about all my journey from here.

Hello! I'm currently working as a Software engineer at [**MJ Legal**](https://mjlegal.com.au) Before that I also worked at a company called Earltech. Before I start working I recieved a BSc in Science from [**USJ**](https://usj.lk) in SriLanka.

My undegraduage reseach was to create Internal Structure Models for Hypothetical Icy Exoplanet. You can find the project report from here [**Internal Structure Models for Hypothetical Icy Exoplanet**][project_report] and python script from here [**Structure-of-Ice-Planet**][python_scripts]
